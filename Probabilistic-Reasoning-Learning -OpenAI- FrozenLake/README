# FrozenLake-v0

The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. 
Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. 
Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. 
The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.


# What is this?

Implementing FrozenLake-v0 using 2 different method

1)Q-learning algorithm 
2)TensorFlow to obtain reward.


#Q-learning algorithm process:

1) Initialize Q-table
2) Choose an action
3) Perfrom action
4) Measured reward
5) Update Q-table
